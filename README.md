##Feature maps:
A particular layer of of CNN model that is formed by filter operation on previous layer to give some specific details of the image.
All feature map should focus on different information of the image.

## Receptive Fields
In Convolution Neural Network receptive fields are region of image or pixels that effect the value of of a unit or pixel group in the network.

## Activation functions
Activation functions are used to introduce non-linearity in the output of neural network.

## Epoch
An epoch is defined as the no. of times the algorithm goes over the whole data for training as going through one data once is not enough.

## FILTERS/KERNELS
It is a set of weights that convolve over the input image to learn different features such as horizontal edge or gradients.

## 1x1 Convolution
1x1 convolution is mainly used to combine features to form new one.

## 3x3 Convolution
When a kernel of size 3x3 is used to convolve over a image to find a specific feature.

## Convolution
It is multiplication of parts of image with set of weights to filter its information as desired features.
To find out the output by providing weightage to its indivdual inputs.
